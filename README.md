# Node with React: Build & Deploy a Fullstack Web Application

## Build & deploy a social network app using React, Typescript, MongoDB, Redis, Queues, AWS, Terraform, CircleCI & more.

React is one of the most popular library's for building client apps with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you want to establish yourself as a front-end or full-stack developer, you need to learn React.

This course follows a hands-on approach or 'learn-by-doing, which means the whole course is structured around building a fullstack web application and the different concepts will be explained detailed as they are introduced.

## What's this course about?

This course is about building a complete fullstack web application from scratch using popular development tools. The curriculum for this course is going to be very hands on as we walk from start to finish building and deploying the application to production. The course is structured into 2 main parts:

- Development (Backend and Frontend)
- Deployment (Infrastructure setup on AWS and CI/CD)

Each structure is broken down into its sections.

- Backend development
- Backend deployment
- Frontend development
- Frontend deployment

Students can go through all the sections or just the sections they are most interested in.

## What Technology You'll Use

We are building a real-time fullstack application with Continuous integration/delivery and automatic deployment, we'll use a variety of technologies.

### Development

- **NodeJS**
- **Typescript and Javascript**
- **React**
- **Redux-toolkit**
- **Redis**
- **MongoDB and Mongoose**
- **Message queues**
- **SocketIO**
- **Jest for unit test**
- **Cloudinary for image and video upload**
- **Nodemailer and Sendgrid mail**
- **and much more...**

### Infrastructure Setup and Deployment

- **Terraform**
- **AWS**
- **CircleCI**

Numerous AWS resources will be used. Some of those resources are:

- **VPC and subnets**
- **Internet gateways**
- **Route tables**
- **NAT gateways and elastic ips**
- **Security groups**
- **Load balancers**
- **Autoscaling groups**
- **EC2 instances**
- **Route53**
- **S3**
- **Code deploy**
- **Elasticache for redis clusters**
- **and much more**

Not familiar with some of these? No problem! This course will guide you on how to setup and use these technologies in your apps.
